# 🧠 WizAI: Intelligent Academic Assistant

> **WizAI** is an intelligent backend system that goes beyond ChatGPT — designed to help students *organize, plan, and automate* their academic life through intelligent agents and seamless integrations.

## Project Overview

### Vision
WizAI is an intelligent backend system that goes beyond ChatGPT by actively organizing student life through:

- **📚 Portal Integration** — Auto-fetches assignments and deadlines from school portals  
- **🧾 Document Intelligence** — Extracts info from screenshots/PDFs to build actionable plans  
- **📅 Calendar Sync** — Bi-directional Google Calendar integration for seamless scheduling  
- **💬 Conversational Planning** — Natural language interface to view, edit, and manage schedules  
- **🤖 Multi-Agent Orchestration** — Specialized agents for planning, extraction, and assistance  
- **⚡ Proactive Automation** — Context-aware suggestions and intelligent workflow triggers  

---

## 💡 Problem Statement
Students struggle with fragmented information across multiple platforms (school portals, email, calendar, and documents).  
Manual organization is **time-consuming** and **error-prone**.  

**WizAI** solves this by creating an intelligent backend that automatically aggregates, processes, and organizes academic life through **AI-powered agents and automation**.

## 👥 Target Users

- College and university students managing multiple courses, assignments, and deadlines  
- Students who want **AI that acts**, not just answers — a productivity system that *does the work* behind the scenes
